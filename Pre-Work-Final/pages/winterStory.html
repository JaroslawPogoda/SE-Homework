	<h3>Winter Story</h3>
	<p> I love winter for one reason only; it allows me to enjoy my favorite hobby, skiing. For as long as I have remember I have always skied. Until I came to United States, It took me 5 years when i skied again. Fist trip was with college club "Extreme goers" with whom I skied and Played paintball with. Since I live in NYC I have great opportunities. Yet no mountains so I started explore things out side nyc and today I can proudly say that i found some of the greatest mountains on the east coast. I have been to it all. So if you are interested in skiing(snowboarding for most in US) or programing hit me up I love both. I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
